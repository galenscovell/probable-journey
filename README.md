# Probable-Journey

### Description

Procedurally generates a dungeon composed of rooms, halls and tiles. The user is then able to click locations within the dungeon and a pathfinding visualization will be displayed showing the shortest path from the entrance to that point.

I made this over the course of a few days to ramp back up on Ruby for an interview!

### Running
* `bundle install`
* `ruby main.rb`
