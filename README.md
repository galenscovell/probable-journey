# Probable-Journey

### Description

Procedurally generates a dungeon composed of rooms, halls and tiles. 
The user is then able to click tiles within the dungeon, and a pathfinding visualization 
will be displayed showing the shortest Euclidean A* path between those points.

I created this project over the course of a few days to ramp back up on Ruby for an interview! ^^

### Running
* `bundle install`
* `ruby main.rb`

### Running Tests
* `rspec .\spec -f d`
